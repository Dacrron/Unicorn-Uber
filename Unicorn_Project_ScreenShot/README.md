# Unicorn-Uber

Not the ordinary vehicle it's 'Unicorn!'

The project is to create a fictional ride-sharing service while using AWS services


## Features

- AWS Lambda: For running backend javascript code, it's serverless.
- Amazon API Gateway: To create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
- Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database service that is used here to store the user information and details about the ride such as name of the unicorn, time of requesting the ride
- Amazon Cognito: To add user sign-up, sign-in.
- AWS Amplify: A set of tools and services to help front-end web and mobile developers build scalable full-stack applications, powered by AWS.
